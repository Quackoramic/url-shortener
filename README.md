# An open source link shortener.

**DEMO:** [url.ellipse.software](https://url.ellipse.software)

## Features

- ðŸ‘® **Privacy**: No tracking feature, privacy first.

- ðŸš€ **Performance**: Built to use Cloudflare's global network.

- ðŸ“¦ **Easy Deployment**: Deploy with one command.

- ðŸ“¡ **Serverless**: No server management required, thanks to Workers.

- ðŸ§ª **Rate limiting**: Rate limiting, built in.

## Setup

1. Clone the latest version of the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/ellipse-software/url-shortener.git
```

2. Install the dependencies using your favorite package manager:

```
npm/yarn/pnpm/bun install
```

3. Install and login to the CLI tool `wrangler`. if you haven't already:

```
wrangler login
```

4. Create a `wrangler.toml` file by copying the `example.wrangler.toml` file:

```
cp example.wrangler.toml wrangler.toml
```

5. Create three KV namespaces using the following commands:

```
wrangler kv namespace create LINKS
```

```
wrangler kv namespace create REVERSE_LINKS
```

```
wrangler kv namespace create LIMITS
```

After creating each namespace, replace the `ID` in your new `wrangler.toml` file with the newly generated `ID` after running each command. If you plan to change the namespace names, make sure to update the code accordingly.

6. Now run the following commands to deploy to Cloudflare:

```
bun run build:worker
```

```
bun run types
```

```
bun run deploy:worker
```

7. _optional_ Uf you would like to enable Discord Webhook Notifications, you can add the `DISCORD_WEBHOOK` secret to your Worker with the following command:

```
wrangler secret put DISCORD_WEBHOOK
```

After this, and redeploying, you will receive notifications on your Discord webhook when a link is requested.

**If there is an error in your configuration, your Worker may purposely error.**
